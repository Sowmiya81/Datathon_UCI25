Here's an example to illustrate how function pointers work in C:\\\\n\\\\n```c\\\\n#include <stdio.h>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\/\\\\/ Function to be pointed to\\\\nint add(int a, int b) {\\\\n    return a + b;\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\/\\\\/ Function to demonstrate function pointers\\\\nvoid functionPointerExample(int (*funcPtr)(int, int)) {\\\\n    int result = funcPtr(5, 10);\\\\n    printf(\\\\\\\"Result: %d\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\", result);\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nint main() {\\\\n    \\\\/\\\\/ Use the address-of operator (&) to get the address of the add function\\\\n    int (*addPtr)(int, int) = &add;\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\/\\\\/ Call the functionPointerExample function and pass the address of the add function\\\\n    functionPointerExample(addPtr);\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\/\\\\/ Call the add function directly\\\\n    int result = add(15, 20);\\\\n    printf(\\\\\\\"Result: %d\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\", result);\\\\n\\\\n    return 0;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, we define a function `add` that takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum.\\\\n\\\\nWe then define a function `functionPointerExample` that takes a function pointer as an argument. This function calls the pointed-to function passing it two integers, and then prints the result.\\\\n\\\\nIn the main function, we create a function pointer `addPtr` which points to the `add` function. We then call the `functionPointerExample` function passing the address of the `add` function using the `&` operator.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, we call the `add` function directly and store the result in a variable `result`.\\\\n\\\\nI hope this helps you understand how function pointers work in C! Let me know if you have any other questions.\\\",\\\"To define a function pointer within a struct, you can define a member variable of the struct as a pointer to a function with a specific return type and argument list. Here's an example:\\\\n\\\\n```c\\\\n#include <stdio.h>\\\\n\\\\n\\\\/\\\\/ Define a structure with a function pointer member\\\\ntypedef struct {\\\\n    int (*calculate)(int);\\\\n} Calculator;\\\\n\\\\n\\\\/\\\\/ Function to be pointed to\\\\nint add(int num) {\\\\n    return num + 10;\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\/\\\\/ Function to demonstrate using a function pointer within a struct\\\\nvoid useCalculator(Calculator calculator) {\\\\n    int result = calculator.calculate(15);\\\\n    printf(\\\\\\\"Result: %d\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\", result);\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nint main() {\\\\n    \\\\/\\\\/ Create a Calculator struct and initialize the function pointer member\\\\n    Calculator calculator = { add };\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\/\\\\/ Call the useCalculator function and pass the calculator struct\\\\n    useCalculator(calculator);\\\\n\\\\n    return 0;\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, we define a `typedef` for our `Calculator` struct, which has a single member `calculate` that is a pointer to a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns an integer.\\\\n\\\\nWe then define a function `add` that adds 10 to the input integer and return the result.\\\\n\\\\nWe define a function `useCalculator` that takes a `Calculator` struct as an argument and invokes the `calculate` member function of the struct with an argument of 15.\\\\n\\\\nIn the `main` function, we create a `Calculator` struct and initialize its `calculate` member with the address of the `add` function. We then call the `useCalculator` function passing the `calculator` struct.\\\\n\\\\nI hope this helps you understand how to define a function pointer within a struct in C!

Her thick, matted hair cascaded down her back, and her skin was tanned and rough from years of living in the harsh wilderness. Ula's husband, Kadan, was a skilled hunter and provided for their small tribe. But lately, even his sharpest arrows seemed to fall short, and food had become scarce.\\\\n\\\\nUla felt a deep ache in her bones and her swollen belly. It was the third trimester, and her baby was growing rapidly. She wondered if she would ever be able to give birth in the cramped, narrow cave. Ula's tribe had no midwife, and her only hope was to rely on the wisdom passed down from her own mother.\\\\n\\\\nOne day, while Kadan was out hunting, Ula went into labor. Her screams echoed through the cave, and her tribe gathered around her in a frenzy. Ula's eyes widened as she felt the intense pain of contractions. She was afraid for her baby's life and her own.\\\\n\\\\nThe tribe tried to comfort Ula, but their efforts fell short. Ula's baby was too big, and the birth seemed impossible. Hours passed, and Ula lost all strength. Her tribe watched in horror as Ula's life slipped away. Suddenly, a loud cry broke the silence. Ula's baby had been born, and he was healthy and strong.\\\\n\\\\nThe tribe rejoiced at the sight of the newborn. They named him Kade, after Ula's husband, Kadan. Kade was a symbol of hope and resilience, and his birth brought new life and energy to the tribe.\\\\n\\\\nAs Ula took her last breath, she whispered to Kade, \\\\\\\"May you grow up to be a fierce and proud caveman, just like your father.\\\\\\\" Ula's legacy lived on through her son, and her tribe honored her memory by carving her name into the walls of the cave. The story of Ula, the heavily pregnant cavewoman who defied death to give birth to Kade, became a legend that would be passed down through the generations.\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_b\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56609,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[\\\"Unfortunately, I do not have enough context to provide specific details about \\\\\\\"mobility123\\\\\\\" in New Jersey.

Her thick, matted hair cascaded down her back, and her skin was tanned and rough from years of living in the harsh wilderness. Ula's husband, Kadan, was a skilled hunter and provided for their small tribe. But lately, even his sharpest arrows seemed to fall short, and food had become scarce.\\\\n\\\\nUla felt a deep ache in her bones and her swollen belly. It was the third trimester, and her baby was growing rapidly. She wondered if she would ever be able to give birth in the cramped, narrow cave. Ula's tribe had no midwife, and her only hope was to rely on the wisdom passed down from her own mother.\\\\n\\\\nOne day, while Kadan was out hunting, Ula went into labor. Her screams echoed through the cave, and her tribe gathered around her in a frenzy. Ula's eyes widened as she felt the intense pain of contractions. She was afraid for her baby's life and her own.\\\\n\\\\nThe tribe tried to comfort Ula, but their efforts fell short. Ula's baby was too big, and the birth seemed impossible. Hours passed, and Ula lost all strength. Her tribe watched in horror as Ula's life slipped away. Suddenly, a loud cry broke the silence. Ula's baby had been born, and he was healthy and strong.\\\\n\\\\nThe tribe rejoiced at the sight of the newborn. They named him Kade, after Ula's husband, Kadan. Kade was a symbol of hope and resilience, and his birth brought new life and energy to the tribe.\\\\n\\\\nAs Ula took her last breath, she whispered to Kade, \\\\\\\"May you grow up to be a fierce and proud caveman, just like your father.\\\\\\\" Ula's legacy lived on through her son, and her tribe honored her memory by carving her name into the walls of the cave. The story of Ula, the heavily pregnant cavewoman who defied death to give birth to Kade, became a legend that would be passed down through the generations.\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_b\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56609,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[\\\"Unfortunately, I do not have enough context to provide specific details about \\\\\\\"mobility123\\\\\\\" in New Jersey.

Her thick, matted hair cascaded down her back, and her skin was tanned and rough from years of living in the harsh wilderness. Ula's husband, Kadan, was a skilled hunter and provided for their small tribe. But lately, even his sharpest arrows seemed to fall short, and food had become scarce.\\\\n\\\\nUla felt a deep ache in her bones and her swollen belly. It was the third trimester, and her baby was growing rapidly. She wondered if she would ever be able to give birth in the cramped, narrow cave. Ula's tribe had no midwife, and her only hope was to rely on the wisdom passed down from her own mother.\\\\n\\\\nOne day, while Kadan was out hunting, Ula went into labor. Her screams echoed through the cave, and her tribe gathered around her in a frenzy. Ula's eyes widened as she felt the intense pain of contractions. She was afraid for her baby's life and her own.\\\\n\\\\nThe tribe tried to comfort Ula, but their efforts fell short. Ula's baby was too big, and the birth seemed impossible. Hours passed, and Ula lost all strength. Her tribe watched in horror as Ula's life slipped away. Suddenly, a loud cry broke the silence. Ula's baby had been born, and he was healthy and strong.\\\\n\\\\nThe tribe rejoiced at the sight of the newborn. They named him Kade, after Ula's husband, Kadan.

While it is commonly believed that our attention spans are decreasing, it is important to note that the issue is complex and multifaceted. Some studies suggest that excessive use of smartphones and social media can have negative effects on attention and cognitive function. These effects may include decreased ability to concentrate, increased distractibility, and reduced ability to engage in sustained attention tasks. However, it is challenging to establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, as multiple factors can influence attention span, including lifestyle, environment, and individual differences. There are also studies that propose alternative perspectives. For instance, some researchers argue that technology use can enhance certain aspects of attention, such as selective attention and multitasking skills. Additionally, the idea of attention spans decreasing may be influenced by the evolving nature of information consumption in the digital age, where people are exposed to a constant stream of stimuli. Overall, it is important to critically evaluate the available scientific evidence and consider that individual experiences and habits can vary. More research is needed to fully understand the complex relationship between technology use, attention spans, and cognitive function.\",\n          \"Here is an inline javascript using p5.js that animates a planet orbiting two stars in a figure 8 pattern, with the planet never coming too close to the stars html function setup() createCanvas(400, 400) let x1 100 let y1 200 let x2 300 let y2 200 let planetX 180 let planetY 100 let angle 0 let speed 0.05 function draw() background(0) Draw the two stars stroke(255) strokeWeight(16) point(x1, y1) point(x2, y2) Calculate planets position let radius 100 let offsetX sin(angle) radius let offsetY cos(angle) radius planetX lerp(x1, x2, 0.5) offsetX planetY y1 offsetY Ensure planet doesnt get too close to stars let minDist 50 let dx1 planetX - x1 let dy1 planetY - y1 if(dist(dx1, dy1) minDist) planetX (minDist - dist(dx1, dy1)) 0.5 planetY (minDist - dist(dx1, dy1)) 0.5 let dx2 planetX - x2 let dy2 planetY - y2 if(dist(dx2, dy2) minDist) planetX - (minDist - dist(dx2, dy2)) 0.5 planetY - (minDist - dist(dx2, dy2)) 0.5 Draw planet stroke(150, 220, 220) strokeWeight(32) point(planetX, planetY) Update angle angle speed This animates the planet in a figure 8 orbit around the two stars, while checking the distance to each star and adjusting the planets position to keep it from getting too close.

You can use regular expressions to search for dates in text, and the re module provides a number of useful functions for working with regular expressions. Here are a few examples of regular expressions that you can use to search for dates in text 1. 1,21,24 This regular expression matches dates in the format MMDDYYYY. The characters match word boundaries, which ensures that the regular expression only matches complete dates and not parts of other words. 2. 4-2-2 This regular expression matches dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD. 3. 422 This regular expression matches dates in the format YYYYMMDD. 4. 422 This regular expression matches dates in the format YYYY MM DD. To use these regular expressions, you can import the re module and then call the search method on a string, passing the regular expression as an argument. For example import re text The meeting is scheduled for 02222022. regex r1,21,24 match re.search(regex, text) if match print(match.group()) This code will print 02222022, which is the date found in the text. You can also use the findall method to find all occurrences of a date in a string. For example text The meeting is scheduled for 02222022. The project is due on 03312022. regex r1,21,24 matches re.findall(regex, text) for match in matches print(match) This code will print 02222022 and 03312022, which are the two dates found in the text. Keep in mind that regular expressions can be complex and difficult to read, so its a good idea to test them carefully and use tools like the Python re modules built-in help function to understand how they work.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_b_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56116,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"When the temperature is 39 Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) outside, its important to take extra precautions to ensure your dogs safety and comfort.

While the intentions behind EA are noble, the movement has faced criticism for its emphasis on quantitative metrics and cost-benefit analyses, which can oversimplify complex social and moral issues. Critics argue that EA can neglect the subjective experiences and perspectives of those being helped, and that its focus on efficiency can lead to a dehumanization of the recipients of aid. Additionally, some have raised concerns that EAs reliance on data and metrics can reinforce systemic biases and overlook marginalized communities. Overall, while Effective Altruism has made important contributions to the discussion about how to do good effectively, it is essential to approach its ideas with critical awareness of its limitations and potential blind spots.\",\n          \"Sure, heres a comparison of average mouse latency in different DPI settings DPI Average Mouse Latency (ms) --- --- 400 8.3 800 7.4 1200 6.9 1600 6.4 2000 6.1 2400 5.8 2800 5.6 3200 5.4 As you can see, the average mouse latency decreases as the DPI setting increases. This is because a higher DPI setting allows for more precise movement, which can result in faster and more accurate cursor movement. However, its worth noting that the optimal DPI setting for a given user will depend on a number of factors, including their personal preference, hand size, and gaming style. Some users may find that a lower DPI setting works better for them, while others may prefer a higher setting. Its also worth noting that the above table shows the average mouse latency for a specific mouse and driver. The actual latency for a given mouse and driver may vary depending on a number of factors, including the mouses hardware, the driver version, and the computers hardware and software configuration. In general, a good gaming mouse will have a low latency, typically in the range of 1-10 ms. However, the exact latency will depend on the specific mouse and driver being used. Its also worth noting that some mice may have additional features, such as adjustable DPI settings or customizable button mappings, which can affect the latency.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

It helped define the grunge genre and ushered in alternative as a major force in pop music. \\\\n\\\\n- \\\\\\\"Respect\\\\\\\" by Aretha Franklin - Aretha's powerful rendition of this Otis Redding song from 1967 is considered a landmark recording and feminist anthem. Her vocals are unmatched. \\\\n\\\\n- \\\\\\\"Imagine\\\\\\\" by John Lennon - The lyricism and humanitarian message of this song resonate deeply with many listeners. Its melody and piano riff are also very iconic.\\\\n\\\\n- \\\\\\\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\\\\\\" by Queen - As a mini rock opera with vivid storytelling, impressive arrangements and Freddie Mercury's incomparable vocals, many fans and music critics consider it a masterwork.\\\\n\\\\nBut even among those, reasonable cases could likely be made for many other songs as the \\\\\\\"best ever.\\\\\\\" Ultimately it comes down to subjective taste and one's criteria for greatness.

In 2016, Black voter turnout rates declined for the first time in 20 years, and this trend could be repeated in 2024 if Black voters do not participate in the election in the same numbers as they did in previous years.\\\\n\\\\nThis is not to say that Black voters will automatically go back to supporting the Democratic party. As Colbert I. King points out in his Washington Post opinion piece, Black voters are a key voting bloc in important battleground states and their support is essential to the Democratic ticket. However, in 2016, many Black voters did not turn out to vote for Hillary Clinton, and this could happen again in 2024 if Black voters feel that their needs are not being met by the Democratic party.\\\\n\\\\nOne potential challenge for the Democratic party is that many Black voters are experiencing flagging enthusiasm amid complaints that the Democratic standard-bearer, Joe Biden, is a bland motivator who has not yet met all the Black community's basic needs. This is similar to the complaints that Black voters had about Hillary Clinton in 2016.\\\\n\\\\nAnother challenge is the current political climate, which is marked by a closely divided Senate, an extremist Republican House, and a 24\\\\/7 opposition messaging campaign aimed at discouraging voting for someone of Biden's age and political moderation. And not much serious thought is being given to the reactionary Republican candidates, which was true in 2016.\\\\n\\\\nIn short, the outcome of the 2024 presidential election will depend on whether Black voters turn out for the Democratic party and whether they feel that their needs are being met by the ticket. As King notes, we will know by next Thanksgiving whether this will happen.\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_b\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56414,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[\\\"B.

Patient Information Age 19 years old Glasses prescription -1.25D for both eyes School hours 8 hours per day Computer use 4 hours per day at 1 meter distance Phone use 2 hours per day at 15-25cm distance with low contrast Preference for darker environments No eye health issues except myopia Always wears glasses, even for close work Assuming the optician mistakenly prescribed 0.5 diopter base out prism for both eyes without anyones knowledge, lets see how this could affect the patient. Effects of 0.5 Diopter Base Out Prism The 0.5 diopter base out prism will cause a small misalignment of the eyes, which may not be noticeable to the patient or the examiner at first. However, over time, this misalignment can lead to a more significant problem. After 2 years, at the patients next exam, the prisms instead of being parallel, will be slightly divergent, with the eyes pointing slightly outward. This can lead to an esophoria, a condition where the eyes have a tendency to turn outward. The patients eyes angle, after 2 years, when looking at infinity, will be slightly divergent, around 1-2 degrees. This might not seem like a lot, but it can cause eye strain, headaches, and difficulty reading or focusing on near objects. Recognition of the Error The patient might not recognize the error immediately, as the misalignment is small. However, over time, she may start to experience symptoms such as eye strain, headaches, or difficulty reading. She might assume these symptoms are due to her myopia or prolonged screen time, without realizing that the prism prescription is the root cause. If the patient does not mention her symptoms to the examiner, the error might not be detected during the next exam. The examiner might assume that the patients slightly divergent eyes are natural, leading to another error or more prism prescription. Possibility of Esophoria The possibility of the patient showing signs of esophoria at the next exam depends on various factors, such as the severity of the prism prescription, the patients eye health, and her daily activities. In this case, since the patient is young and healthy, and the prism prescription is small, the likelihood of developing esophoria is relatively low. However, if the patient continues to wear the incorrect prism prescription for an extended period, the misalignment can become more significant, leading to a higher risk of developing esophoria. Conclusion A small unnecessary base out prism prescription can lead to a misalignment of the eyes, which, over time, can cause eye strain, headaches, and difficulty reading or focusing on near objects. It is crucial for opticians to accurately prescribe prism and for patients to communicate any symptoms or concerns to their eye care professionals to prevent such errors and ensure proper eye health.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_b_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56036,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1.

Some songs that often get mentioned as being among the best in pop music history include:\\\\n\\\\n- \\\\\\\"Hey Jude\\\\\\\" by The Beatles - Its epic length, memorable melody, uplifting lyrics and climactic ending tend to earn it very high praise.\\\\n\\\\n- \\\\\\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\\\\\\" by Nirvana - It had a massive cultural impact and influence when it was released in 1991. It helped define the grunge genre and ushered in alternative as a major force in pop music. \\\\n\\\\n- \\\\\\\"Respect\\\\\\\" by Aretha Franklin - Aretha's powerful rendition of this Otis Redding song from 1967 is considered a landmark recording and feminist anthem. Her vocals are unmatched. \\\\n\\\\n- \\\\\\\"Imagine\\\\\\\" by John Lennon - The lyricism and humanitarian message of this song resonate deeply with many listeners. Its melody and piano riff are also very iconic.\\\\n\\\\n- \\\\\\\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\\\\\\" by Queen - As a mini rock opera with vivid storytelling, impressive arrangements and Freddie Mercury's incomparable vocals, many fans and music critics consider it a masterwork.\\\\n\\\\nBut even among those, reasonable cases could likely be made for many other songs as the \\\\\\\"best ever.\\\\\\\" Ultimately it comes down to subjective taste and one's criteria for greatness.

In 2016, Black voter turnout rates declined for the first time in 20 years, and this trend could be repeated in 2024 if Black voters do not participate in the election in the same numbers as they did in previous years.\\\\n\\\\nThis is not to say that Black voters will automatically go back to supporting the Democratic party. As Colbert I. King points out in his Washington Post opinion piece, Black voters are a key voting bloc in important battleground states and their support is essential to the Democratic ticket. However, in 2016, many Black voters did not turn out to vote for Hillary Clinton, and this could happen again in 2024 if Black voters feel that their needs are not being met by the Democratic party.\\\\n\\\\nOne potential challenge for the Democratic party is that many Black voters are experiencing flagging enthusiasm amid complaints that the Democratic standard-bearer, Joe Biden, is a bland motivator who has not yet met all the Black community's basic needs. This is similar to the complaints that Black voters had about Hillary Clinton in 2016.\\\\n\\\\nAnother challenge is the current political climate, which is marked by a closely divided Senate, an extremist Republican House, and a 24\\\\/7 opposition messaging campaign aimed at discouraging voting for someone of Biden's age and political moderation. And not much serious thought is being given to the reactionary Republican candidates, which was true in 2016.\\\\n\\\\nIn short, the outcome of the 2024 presidential election will depend on whether Black voters turn out for the Democratic party and whether they feel that their needs are being met by the ticket. As King notes, we will know by next Thanksgiving whether this will happen.\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_b\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56414,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[\\\"B.

Patient Information Age 19 years old Glasses prescription -1.25D for both eyes School hours 8 hours per day Computer use 4 hours per day at 1 meter distance Phone use 2 hours per day at 15-25cm distance with low contrast Preference for darker environments No eye health issues except myopia Always wears glasses, even for close work Assuming the optician mistakenly prescribed 0.5 diopter base out prism for both eyes without anyones knowledge, lets see how this could affect the patient. Effects of 0.5 Diopter Base Out Prism The 0.5 diopter base out prism will cause a small misalignment of the eyes, which may not be noticeable to the patient or the examiner at first. However, over time, this misalignment can lead to a more significant problem. After 2 years, at the patients next exam, the prisms instead of being parallel, will be slightly divergent, with the eyes pointing slightly outward. This can lead to an esophoria, a condition where the eyes have a tendency to turn outward. The patients eyes angle, after 2 years, when looking at infinity, will be slightly divergent, around 1-2 degrees. This might not seem like a lot, but it can cause eye strain, headaches, and difficulty reading or focusing on near objects. Recognition of the Error The patient might not recognize the error immediately, as the misalignment is small. However, over time, she may start to experience symptoms such as eye strain, headaches, or difficulty reading. She might assume these symptoms are due to her myopia or prolonged screen time, without realizing that the prism prescription is the root cause. If the patient does not mention her symptoms to the examiner, the error might not be detected during the next exam. The examiner might assume that the patients slightly divergent eyes are natural, leading to another error or more prism prescription. Possibility of Esophoria The possibility of the patient showing signs of esophoria at the next exam depends on various factors, such as the severity of the prism prescription, the patients eye health, and her daily activities. In this case, since the patient is young and healthy, and the prism prescription is small, the likelihood of developing esophoria is relatively low. However, if the patient continues to wear the incorrect prism prescription for an extended period, the misalignment can become more significant, leading to a higher risk of developing esophoria. Conclusion A small unnecessary base out prism prescription can lead to a misalignment of the eyes, which, over time, can cause eye strain, headaches, and difficulty reading or focusing on near objects. It is crucial for opticians to accurately prescribe prism and for patients to communicate any symptoms or concerns to their eye care professionals to prevent such errors and ensure proper eye health.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_b_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56036,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1.

Some songs that often get mentioned as being among the best in pop music history include:\\\\n\\\\n- \\\\\\\"Hey Jude\\\\\\\" by The Beatles - Its epic length, memorable melody, uplifting lyrics and climactic ending tend to earn it very high praise.\\\\n\\\\n- \\\\\\\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\\\\\\" by Nirvana - It had a massive cultural impact and influence when it was released in 1991. It helped define the grunge genre and ushered in alternative as a major force in pop music. \\\\n\\\\n- \\\\\\\"Respect\\\\\\\" by Aretha Franklin - Aretha's powerful rendition of this Otis Redding song from 1967 is considered a landmark recording and feminist anthem. Her vocals are unmatched. \\\\n\\\\n- \\\\\\\"Imagine\\\\\\\" by John Lennon - The lyricism and humanitarian message of this song resonate deeply with many listeners. Its melody and piano riff are also very iconic.\\\\n\\\\n- \\\\\\\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\\\\\\" by Queen - As a mini rock opera with vivid storytelling, impressive arrangements and Freddie Mercury's incomparable vocals, many fans and music critics consider it a masterwork.\\\\n\\\\nBut even among those, reasonable cases could likely be made for many other songs as the \\\\\\\"best ever.\\\\\\\" Ultimately it comes down to subjective taste and one's criteria for greatness.

In 2016, Black voter turnout rates declined for the first time in 20 years, and this trend could be repeated in 2024 if Black voters do not participate in the election in the same numbers as they did in previous years.\\\\n\\\\nThis is not to say that Black voters will automatically go back to supporting the Democratic party. As Colbert I. King points out in his Washington Post opinion piece, Black voters are a key voting bloc in important battleground states and their support is essential to the Democratic ticket. However, in 2016, many Black voters did not turn out to vote for Hillary Clinton, and this could happen again in 2024 if Black voters feel that their needs are not being met by the Democratic party.\\\\n\\\\nOne potential challenge for the Democratic party is that many Black voters are experiencing flagging enthusiasm amid complaints that the Democratic standard-bearer, Joe Biden, is a bland motivator who has not yet met all the Black community's basic needs. This is similar to the complaints that Black voters had about Hillary Clinton in 2016.\\\\n\\\\nAnother challenge is the current political climate, which is marked by a closely divided Senate, an extremist Republican House, and a 24\\\\/7 opposition messaging campaign aimed at discouraging voting for someone of Biden's age and political moderation. And not much serious thought is being given to the reactionary Republican candidates, which was true in 2016.\\\\n\\\\nIn short, the outcome of the 2024 presidential election will depend on whether Black voters turn out for the Democratic party and whether they feel that their needs are being met by the ticket. As King notes, we will know by next Thanksgiving whether this will happen.\\\"]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_b\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56414,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[\\\"B.

Patient Information Age 19 years old Glasses prescription -1.25D for both eyes School hours 8 hours per day Computer use 4 hours per day at 1 meter distance Phone use 2 hours per day at 15-25cm distance with low contrast Preference for darker environments No eye health issues except myopia Always wears glasses, even for close work Assuming the optician mistakenly prescribed 0.5 diopter base out prism for both eyes without anyones knowledge, lets see how this could affect the patient. Effects of 0.5 Diopter Base Out Prism The 0.5 diopter base out prism will cause a small misalignment of the eyes, which may not be noticeable to the patient or the examiner at first. However, over time, this misalignment can lead to a more significant problem. After 2 years, at the patients next exam, the prisms instead of being parallel, will be slightly divergent, with the eyes pointing slightly outward. This can lead to an esophoria, a condition where the eyes have a tendency to turn outward. The patients eyes angle, after 2 years, when looking at infinity, will be slightly divergent, around 1-2 degrees. This might not seem like a lot, but it can cause eye strain, headaches, and difficulty reading or focusing on near objects. Recognition of the Error The patient might not recognize the error immediately, as the misalignment is small. However, over time, she may start to experience symptoms such as eye strain, headaches, or difficulty reading. She might assume these symptoms are due to her myopia or prolonged screen time, without realizing that the prism prescription is the root cause. If the patient does not mention her symptoms to the examiner, the error might not be detected during the next exam. The examiner might assume that the patients slightly divergent eyes are natural, leading to another error or more prism prescription. Possibility of Esophoria The possibility of the patient showing signs of esophoria at the next exam depends on various factors, such as the severity of the prism prescription, the patients eye health, and her daily activities. In this case, since the patient is young and healthy, and the prism prescription is small, the likelihood of developing esophoria is relatively low. However, if the patient continues to wear the incorrect prism prescription for an extended period, the misalignment can become more significant, leading to a higher risk of developing esophoria. Conclusion A small unnecessary base out prism prescription can lead to a misalignment of the eyes, which, over time, can cause eye strain, headaches, and difficulty reading or focusing on near objects. It is crucial for opticians to accurately prescribe prism and for patients to communicate any symptoms or concerns to their eye care professionals to prevent such errors and ensure proper eye health.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response_b_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 56036,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1.
